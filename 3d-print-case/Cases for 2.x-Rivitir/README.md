## Case Options

### 1) Thin Case (full enclosure)

- **Purpose:** daily protection with a slim profile that still allows good grip and access to controls.
- **Lids:**  
  - **Solid Lid** (no magnets) — clean look, maximum rigidity.  
  - **Magnet Lid** — same geometry with Ø**12.5 mm** × **1.5 mm** pockets for disc magnets.
- **Fasteners:** **6× M3** screws into **M3 heat-set inserts** (install depth **5 mm**).
- **Access & cooling:** body shape preserves ventilation paths and control access (depends on radio model cutouts).

### 2) Cradle Case (radio + phone)

- **Purpose:** mount the HT and keep your **phone docked** for digital modes, logging, APRS maps, etc.
- **Radio interface:** same magnet pocket spec (Ø**12.5 mm**, **1.5 mm** depth) to attach to a radio-mounted backplate.
- **Phone shelf:** flat cradle surface with front lip; add thin foam or rubber tape for grip and to protect the phone.
- **Cable-friendly:** open edges accommodate common audio/PTT or data cables (model-dependent).

## Bill of Materials (per case)

| Item | Spec | Qty | Notes |
|---|---|---:|---|
| Heat-set inserts | M3, **5 mm** install depth (standard brass) | 6 | Thin Case only |
| Screws | M3×6–8 pan head | 6 | Match length to your printer’s fit |
| Magnets | Disc Ø**12.5 mm** × **1–1.5 mm** | up to pockets | Use N35–N52 neodymium |
| Adhesive for magnets | CA (super glue) or 5-min epoxy | — | CA is quick, epoxy is stronger |
| Foam/rubber tape (optional) | 1–2 mm thick | as needed | Phone shelf grip / anti-rattle |

> The magnet pockets are **1.5 mm deep**. If your magnets are 1.0 mm thick, add a thin CA layer or adhesive pad behind them to sit flush.

## Printing Guidelines

- **Material:** PETG recommended (tough and heat-resistant). ABS/ASA also good for outdoor use. PLA+ is acceptable indoors.
- **Layer height:** 0.20 mm (0.16–0.24 mm works).
- **Perimeters:** 3–4 walls for strength around inserts and magnets.
- **Infill:** 20–30% gyroid or grid (40% for the phone shelf if you prefer extra rigidity).
- **Top/Bottom:** 4–6 layers.
- **Supports:** Only if your printer struggles with the phone lip or specific overhangs (most parts are support-light).
- **Orientation:**  
  - **Thin Case body/lid:** print flat on the largest face.  
  - **Cradle body:** print flat on the backplate side; phone shelf flat.

## Assembly — Thin Case

1. **Test fit the printed parts.** Clean any brim/elephant’s foot so edges meet flush.
2. **Install heat-set inserts** (6× M3):  
   - Set a soldering iron to a temperature appropriate for your plastic (typ. **200–240 °C** for PETG; lower for PLA).  
   - Press inserts straight down to **5 mm** depth. Keep square—do not over-melt.
3. **(Optional) Install magnets** in the **magnet lid**:  
   - Dry-fit magnets into the Ø**12.5 mm** × **1.5 mm** pockets.  
   - **Mark polarity** before gluing so this lid matches your other magnet surfaces.  
   - Bond with a small drop of CA; press flush. Let cure.
4. **Mount the radio** in the case body; verify clearance for knobs, PTT, jacks, and battery latch.
5. **Fasten the lid** with M3×6–8 screws. Tighten snugly—no need to over-torque.

## Assembly — Cradle Case

1. **Dry fit** the cradle body and phone shelf; ensure your phone sits securely.
2. **Add grip**: apply 1–2 mm foam/rubber tape to the shelf to protect the phone and prevent sliding.
3. **Install magnets** (if used) in Ø**12.5 mm** × **1.5 mm** pockets. Keep polarity consistent with your radio backplate.
4. **Mate the cradle** to the magnetized radio backplate. Check cable clearance for your setup.

## Magnet Polarity Tips

- Choose a **standard**: e.g., “logo side = North.” Mark one face of all magnets before installation.
- Always **test polarity** against the mating part before gluing. Magnets are unforgiving once set.

## Compatibility & Remixes

- These enclosures are designed around the **KV4P open-source HT project version 2.0** geometry.
- PRs with alternate cutouts, belt-clip adapters, lanyard loops, or tripod-mount blocks are welcome.

## Case Types

- Phone Cradle Case - This design allows you to cradle your phone and gives you a pocket where you can place items such as your USB cable. Tested with a Google Pixel 5a phone.
- Thin Case - This is a case to fully enclose your radio while keeping the footprint as small as possible. Has built-in PTT switch that doesn't protrude.
